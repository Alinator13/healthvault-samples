Please make sure you've reviewed the Getting Started documentation on [Action Plans](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/healthvault/mt778893).

To run this sample: 
1. In the web.config, update the ApplicationId setting to the ID for the application you created in ACC.
2. Make sure the private key for the application is installed on your machine. (See section 4.2 in the Getting Started document.)
3. Build and run the solution.
    -> This should automatically restore the HealthVault.NET NuGet package, and all other NuGet packages required by the project.
